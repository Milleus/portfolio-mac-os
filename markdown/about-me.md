# About Me

Hi there! o/

My name is Dave and I'm a software Dave-loper (pun intended) who is currently working at [GDS Hive](https://www.hive.tech.gov.sg/) at [GovTech Singapore](https://www.tech.gov.sg/), where we're engineering digital government and making lives better.

My interest lies primarily in frontend development where I get to suffer dealing with iOS Safari browser compatibility issues, mess around with CSS animations and explore upcoming web technology such as new browser APIs and variable fonts.

I code mostly with React and TypeScript, some of the projects that I've been involved in are:

- Immigrations and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) National Registration Identity Card related e-Services
- COVID-19 related websites such as GoWhere, MaskGoWhere, and VoteQGoWhere.
- Whole of Government Analytics Application.

Iâ€™m currently working on:

- ICA NRIC related e-Services (work).
- A pilot project with a non-profit organisation to develop a web portal to teach children with autism on life necessities (volunteer).
- A website simulating macOS Monterey GUI (side project, this website).
